- MComp Computing Sciences Graduate from UEA, full time Software Developer
- **Learning Go/Scala/Zig** in that order, but for different reasons
- On the backend grind
- Algorithms
- Focusing on learning Go at a more proficient level, but learning Zig for fun.
- Interests in SoftDev, AI, ML, Cyber Security and Statistics but trust me it's pretty much everything.
- Bioinformatic interests: Anything structural bioinformatics. Protein structure prediction, protein-protein interactions and protein-function
- Languages: Python, Typescript, Go, Java, C++, Zig, C, R, MATLAB (in order of competency)
- Always eager to learn: OS and Architectures (low level), Cyber Security (especially Pen. Testing, Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering) and Software Development.
- Open to collaborations!

- Extensive List of learning: Go for Backend, Scala for Backend+Data Eng, Zig for Low Level + Networks, dlt+dbt for Data Eng
